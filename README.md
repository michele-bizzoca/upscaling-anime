<h1 align="center">Anime Ultrascale<br>A Tool for Extreme Anime Upscaling</h1>

Ever thought how an anime image's lifecycle can impact its quality?

For  example,  an  enthusiast  creates  an  image  and publishes it on an online
platform.  The  platform  requires  downscaling and conversion to JPG. The image
travels  across  the  WWW,  until  someone  uses  it on their own website, prior
upscaling and export to JPG. Finally, you see the image, and download it.

What you downloaded and its original version are separated by *information loss*
(due  to  downscaling),  a  *false  perception  of  the downscaled size* (due to
upscaling),  and 4 *layers of artifacts* (2 due to down/up scaling, and 2 due to
JPG compression).

While  it  is  impossible  to  reconstruct  the original version from the final,
nowadays  it is possible to get a could-be original version, namely a picture of
the  same  size  and  detail level of the original which, when downscaled, turns
into  the  picture  you  downloaded.  This  is  possible  thanks  to  artificial
intelligence models.

I  summarized  my experience on this topic in a workflow for extreme restoration
of  anime  images, which can be executed with freely available and simple-to-use
tools.  It  is  presented,  with  an example of 170x resolution increase, in the
article
[**Upscaling Anime**](https://github.com/michele-bizzoca/upscaling-anime), which
you can [**Read Online**](https://michele-bizzoca.github.io/upscaling-anime/).

Later,  I turned Upscaling Anime into a fully automatic program, and added extra
features  to it, like automatic upscaling inversion, progress bar, preset files,
advanced     logging     and     format     expressions.     Its     name     is
[**Anime Ultrascale**](https://github.com/michele-bizzoca/anime-ultrascale).  It
is  written  as  a single Python file which can be run anywhere. Installation is
available for Ubuntu.

Anime  Ultrascale is distributed under the MIT license, which permits commercial
use,  together  with  high quality models usable for commercial purposes. Useful
non-commercial  models  for  which  I  could  not  find  a permissively licensed
replacement         are         available        separately        in        the
[**Anime Ultrascale NC**](https://github.com/michele-bizzoca/anime-ultrascale-nc)
repository.
