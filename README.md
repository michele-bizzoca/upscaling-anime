<h1 align="center">Anime Upscaling<br>A Workflow for Extreme Anime Upscaling</h1>

Ever thought how an anime image's lifecycle can impact its quality?

For  example, an enthusiast creates an image and publishes it on a platform. The
platform  requires  downscaling  and conversion to JPG. The image travels across
the  WWW, until someone uses it on their own website, prior upscaling and export
to JPG. Finally, you see the image, and download it.

What you downloaded and its original version are separated by *information loss*
(due  to  downscaling),  a  *false  perception  of  the downscaled size* (due to
upscaling),  and 4 *layers of artifacts* (2 due to down/up scaling, and 2 due to
JPG compression).

While  it  is  impossible  to  reconstruct  the original version from the final,
nowadays  it is possible to get a could-be original version, namely a picture of
the  same  size  and  detail level of the original which, when downscaled, turns
into  the  picture  you  downloaded.  This  is  possible  thanks  to  artificial
intelligence models.

I  summarized  my experience on this topic in a workflow for extreme restoration 
of  anime  images, which can be executed with freely available and simple-to-use 
tools.  It  is  presented,  with  an example of 170x resolution increase, in the 
article [**Anime Upscaling**](https://github.com/michele-bizzoca/anime-upscaling), 
which you can [**Read Online**](https://michele-bizzoca.github.io/anime-upscaling/).

Later, I  turned Anime Upscaling into a fully automatic program, and added extra
features to it, like  automatic upscaling inversion, progress bar, preset files,
advanced  logging  and  format  expressions.  Its  name is [**Anime Ultrascale**
](https://github.com/michele-bizzoca/anime-ultrascale).  It   is  written  as  a
single  Python  file  which  can  be run anywhere. Installation is available for 
Ubuntu.
